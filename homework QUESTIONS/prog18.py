### PRACTICAL FOR XI CS - 2020-21 #
# 18.	Write a program to store marks of students in two different
#    list and find out whether they are identical or different

"""
Method 1 : Using list.sort() and == operator
sort() coupled with == operator can achieve this task.
We first sort the list, so that if both the lists are identical,
then they have elements at the same position.
But this doesnâ€™t take into account the ordering of elements in list.

# Python 3 code to demonstrate 
# check if list are identical 
# using sort() + == operator 

# initializing lists 
test_list1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] 
test_list2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 

# printing lists 
print ("The first list is : " + str(test_list1)) 
print ("The second list is : " + str(test_list2)) 

# sorting both the lists 
test_list1.sort() 
test_list2.sort() 

# using == to check if 
# lists are equal 
if test_list1 == test_list2: 
	print ("The lists are identical") 
else : 
	print ("The lists are not identical")
